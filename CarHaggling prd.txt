CarHaggling: Website & Marketing Strategy (Smoke Test)
Objective: This document outlines the strategy, design, and content for a high-fidelity marketing website for "CarHaggling." The primary goal is not to build a functional product, but to execute a "smoke test" to validate market demand for an AI-powered car buying service by maximizing user signups for a waitlist.
Brand Identity (Enhanced):
* Name: CarHaggling
* Tagline: Your AI Co-Pilot for Car Buying.
* Core Message: We combine the exhaustive power of AI with a human touch to make buying a used car simple, transparent, and even enjoyable.
* Tone: Tech-savvy, sophisticated, reassuring, and empowering. The design and copy should feel like a premium FinTech service (think Wealthfront meets a high-end concierge).
1. Product Requirements Document (PRD)
1.1. Overview
The website will serve as the primary marketing funnel to capture interest for CarHaggling. It must tell a compelling story, build trust in a novel AI-driven process, and guide the user seamlessly toward the waitlist signup.
1.2. Key Sections & Features
Header
* Logo: Clean, modern "CarHaggling" logotype.
* Navigation: How It Works, Our AI, Customer Stories, FAQ.
* Primary CTA: Get Started (triggers the signup modal).
Hero Section (Enhanced for Engagement)
* Headline (H1): Buy Your Next Car at Light Speed.
* Sub-headline (p): CarHaggling's AI co-pilot scans the entire market, vets every vehicle, and negotiates the price for you. Stop wasting weekends. Start your search in 60 seconds.
* Interactive CTA: Instead of a simple email field, this will be a more engaging, multi-step input:
   1. User sees icons: [SUV] [Sedan] [Truck] [Coupe] [EV].
   2. Upon clicking an icon, the form elegantly transitions to ask for their email.
   3. Button: Find My Perfect [SUV] → (The button text dynamically updates).
* Visual: A sophisticated Lottie animation depicting data flowing, car icons being analyzed, and a final, verified car icon being presented. This communicates the concept more effectively than a static image.
* Live Social Proof Ticker (Animated): A subtle, scrolling ticker at the bottom of the hero section with messages like:
   * “Just saved Mark T. in Los Angeles $2,150 on a 2021 Honda CR-V...”
   * “Found a mint-condition 2019 Ford F-150 for Sarah P. in Austin...”
Trust Bar
* Sleek logos of "As seen on" publications: MotorTrend, TechCrunch, WIRED, Road & Track.

2. Solution & Concept Document
2.1. The Core Problem
The used car buying process is broken. It's an inefficient, high-stress, and opaque experience filled with information asymmetry that favors the seller. Consumers waste dozens of hours and often overpay by thousands due to negotiation anxiety and a lack of market knowledge.
2.2. The CarHaggling Solution
CarHaggling is a personal AI advocate that levels the playing field. It's a "set it and forget it" service that automates the most painful parts of the car buying journey. We deploy a sophisticated AI co-pilot to work 24/7 on the user's behalf, transforming a frustrating chore into a simple, confident, and financially sound decision.
2.3. The Business Model (for the pitch)
* Success-Based Fee: We operate on a model that aligns our success with our users'. We charge a commission only when a user successfully purchases a vehicle found and negotiated by our service.
* Risk-Free: If we don't find you a car you love, you pay absolutely nothing.
2.4. Core Value Propositions
* Save Time: Get your weekends back. We do the searching, vetting, and haggling.
* Save Money: Our AI negotiates like an expert, ensuring you never overpay.
* Buy with Confidence: Every car on your shortlist is thoroughly vetted with professional history reports and analysis.
* Effortless & Modern: Experience the future of major purchases—simple, transparent, and powered by intelligent automation.
3. Frontend Implementation Guide for Cursor/Developer
3.1. Technical Stack
* Framework: None required. Use vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for speed and simplicity.
* Styling: Use a modern approach. CSS variables for colors/fonts. Flexbox and Grid for layouts. Ensure it is fully responsive.
* Animations: Use Lottie for complex animations (the hero visual, the "scanning" sequence). Use CSS transitions for button hovers, card effects, and modal fades.
* Analytics: Integrate Google Tag Manager (GTM) from the start to track button clicks and funnel progression.
3.2. HTML Structure (index.html)
* Use semantic HTML5 tags (<header>, <section>, <footer>, etc.).
* Ensure all interactive elements are accessible (<button>, <a> with href).
* The multi-step modal will be a single <div> element that is hidden by default (display: none;). Its child <div> elements will represent the steps.
3.3. CSS Styling (styles.css)
* Color Palette:
   * Primary Action: A vibrant, tech-forward blue or purple (e.g., #6A5AF9).
   * Background: Off-white or very light gray (e.g., #F8F9FA) for a clean, premium feel.
   * Text: Dark charcoal (e.g., #212529), not pure black.
* Typography:
   * Font: Use a modern, clean sans-serif font like Inter or Plus Jakarta Sans from Google Fonts.
   * Hierarchy: Establish clear visual hierarchy with font sizes and weights. Headlines should be bold and impactful.
* Layout: Design for mobile-first, then use media queries to adapt for tablet and desktop. The main content should be centered with a max-width of around 1200px.
3.4. JavaScript Logic (script.js)
* Modal Management:
   * Create functions openModal(), closeModal(), and showStep(stepNum).
   * showStep() will hide all step divs and show only the target one.
* Interactive Hero:
   * Add event listeners to the car type icons. On click, they should:
      1. Add an "active" class for styling.
      2. Update the text of the main CTA button.
      3. Animate the appearance of the email input field.
* Theatrical Animation Logic:
   * The startLoadingAnimation() function is key. Use setTimeout or Promises to chain the animation sequence:
      1. Typing Effect: Use setInterval to append characters to the "searching for" text.
      2. Scanning Logos: Have an array of logo URLs. Use setInterval to cycle through them in an <img> tag.
      3. Status Updates: Have an array of the status strings. Use setInterval to append a new <li> to a <ul> every ~500ms.
      4. Card Animation: After the statuses finish, add CSS classes to the blurred card elements to trigger a fade-in/fly-in animation.
* Form Submission (Frontend part):
   * Attach an event listener to the form inside the modal.
   * On submit, prevent the default action.
   * Perform basic validation (e.g., email.includes('@')).
   * For this smoke test, you don't need to send data to a backend. The primary goal is to see if users complete the funnel.
   * Upon successful "submission" (i.e., validation passes), immediately trigger the startLoadingAnimation().
